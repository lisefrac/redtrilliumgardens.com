## To Dos
- Create socials
- Create newsletter
- Logo
- Favicon and social sharing images
- Resources page
- Canonical links
- target blank and correct rel values on links - is there a shortcode for these?
- figure out why hero image doesn't work on preview URLs - it's using baseURL instead of "/", I know, but how do I change that?
- Test if custom CSS works now that I'm using Hugo modules to install theme
