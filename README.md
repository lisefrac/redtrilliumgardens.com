## Done
- [x] list of what we're growing for the 2024 season
- [x] Create newsletter
- [x] Logo
  - at least a shitty handmade one, lol
- [x] figure out why hero image doesn't work on preview URLs - it's using baseURL instead of "/", I know, but how do I change that?
  - I fixed this but I can't remember how
- [x] Test if custom CSS works now that I'm using Hugo modules to install theme
  - it does, but I think it working had more to do with correctly using hugo.toml instead of config.toml
