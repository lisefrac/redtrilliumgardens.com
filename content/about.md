Red Trillium Gardens is the work of Lise Fracalossi (aka, me) of Lunenburg, MA. 

While I've always enjoyed the natural world in general, and plants in particular, during the pandemic, I became invested in the importance of native plants to the entire ecosystem. I began pursuing my Native Plant Studies certification from Native Plant Trust in late 2022. 

When I lost my corporate job recently, I decided it was a good time to try something new. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about native plants, to teach about native plants, and to advocate for native plants. **I will do that by putting native plants of this ecoregion into people's hands, with the information they need to help them thrive, at reasonable prices.**

I am currently in the process of winter sowing seeds for sale in Spring 2024. I plan to sell these at local farmers' markets (fingers crossed) and the fleamarket across from Bangkok Hill restaurant in Lunenburg. 

More details soon!
