## Stuff We Like or Recommend

As far as plants and ecology goes, we like:

**iNaturalist.org**. Take pictures of plants (or any sort of life!), upload them, get IDs, and engage in citizen science.

**Douglas Tallamy.** I highly recommend his books, especially _Nature's Best Hope_. This opened my eyes to the threats facing the entire ecological web, and what a single homeowner can do about it. (Spoiler: it's his [Homegrown National Park] project).

**Learn Your Land**, by Adam Hariton. Hariton is located in western PA, but his knowledge and advice is useful wherever you are based. More than individual species, he teaches a "hyperlocal" way of being that is deeply rooted in place. He also thinks critically about received wisdom in ecological discourse, examining it more holistically. 

**Crime Pays But Botany Doesn't**. Joey Santore talks like a Chicago mobster (complete with pottymouth -- but that's me, too) but knows more than I can imagine about plants worldwide. How can you not respect a guy who has a metric ruler tattooed on his finger so he can measure things in the field? I too am a fan of killing your lawn and some (light, ethical) unauthorized forestry.

**Black Forager**

**Native Plant Trust/Garden in the Woods**

**r/nativeplantgardening.** Some native plant communities can be... exasperating and elitist. Not this one! I've found it to be educational and level-headed; when I was questioning if I should continue my mosquito spraying service, they educated me (kindly!) on the dangers of permethrin and what my alternatives were. I belong to a native plant Zoom group that started from this. 

**Fraser Valley Rose Farm**. No, he doesn't grow native roses (and he's in Canada!) but I've learned a lot about horticulture and the nursery business from him. What makes him stand out, though, is that among the sea of exploitative practices in the nursery business -- I could write a blog post on that! -- he pays more attention to sustainability than most.

**David the Good**. Same thing. I don't agree with everything he writes or says, but he wrote possibly the best book on starting a backyard nursery.  

**Garden Fundamentals**. Another gardening YTer I follow. He doesn't focus on native plants, but he is/was a chemist in his day job, and so all of his info is grounded in science. He runs a great website, gardenmyths.com, which I've taken to searching whenever I hear of some garden home remedy. (No, epsom salts will not cure blossom end rot, and pissing on your plants isn't a great way to fertilize them).
