_(Updated: September 14, 2024)_

Since we are so new, buying plants from us is a little different! Please **read the full details** before emailing us your order/reservation. 

## "What do you currently have available?"

List below. Note that these are mostly **plug-sized plants**, in ~3.5"-4" (1 pint) containers. We also have a few quart-sized containers available at this time.

### Native annuals - on sale!

We are marking these plants down as the season is coming to an end. At this point, the partridge pea has flowered, and the black nightshade is in fruit, so they are mostly going to be useful for seed collection.

- American black nightshade (Solanum ptycanthum or S. americanum or S. emulans or whatever they're calling it these days!) - <strike>$4</strike> $2 for a pint pot with 1-3 plants (depending on individual seedling size)
- [Partridge pea](/info-sheets/cha-fas/) - Chamaecrista fasciculata - <strike>$7</strike> $4 for a quart pot.

### "Zoigls" - $3 pint or 2 for $5

"Zoigl" originally referred to a specific style of home-brewn, unfiltered German beer with no shelf life. It's also used to describe a beer that didn't quite come out as expected, and thus isn't suitable for wide distribution -- a "factory second," if you will. 

What does this have to do with native plants? Well, we have some plants that didn't quite come out as planned, or that we can't identify to species level. We're marking these down to $2 each.

- _Monarda?_ These seeds were labeled Monarda punctata (spotted bee-balm), but have produced plants that look more like Monarda fistulosa (wild bee-balm or wild bergamot). I'll know when they flower, but in the meantime, you can get a discount on a lovely native that -- regardless of species -- has sweet-scented leaves and flowers.
- _Symphyotrichum cordifolium (blue wood aster; heart leaved aster) or Eurybia divaricata? (white wood aster)_ These are from seeds I collected last year, but I didn't key out the plant when it was flowering. All I know they are asters, i.e. from one of the genera that used to be lumped into genus _Aster_, before it was split into 10 different genera(!) With only leaves to go on, I can't tell them apart (nor can iNaturalist!) Either way, both are native species that produce a white or whitish-blue flower in late summer or early fall (when many other flowers are beginning to fade), and thrive in very similar conditions (partial shade with medium to medium-dry soil). Until they flower, benefit from my mistake!
- _Milkweeds (Asclepias)_. These were given to me to sell, with the caveat that they were either swamp milkweed (A. incarnata) or common milkweed (A. syriaca), but the person didn't know which.
-_Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia) F2 hybrid_. I grew these from seed collected from my own 'Goldsturm' Rudbeckia, a no-longer-under-patent cultivar which crosses Rudbeckia fulgida (orange coneflower) with Rudbeckia hirta (what is most commonly called black-eyed Susan). The offspring of an first-generation hybrid is called an F2, and they are generally less vigorous than F1s. But if you are looking for a discount, or we're out of the straight species, this is a good choice! 

### Non-native perennials - <strike>$4 each</strike> $2 each or 3 for $5

As we come to the end of the planting season, we are marking down many of our non-natives so that we can focus on our natives.

- Lemon Balm - 'Mandarina' (smells like oranges!)
- Oregano (only 1Ô∏è‚É£ one plant left!)

- Basil

## Non-native houseplants
- Christmas/Thanksgiving cactus (genus Schlumbergera)

## "What will you have available later in the year?"

Please refer to our ["What We're Growing for 2024"](/posts/whats-growing-2024/) post. Note that none of these are guarantees, because after a certain point, Mother Nature takes the wheel ü§£

Plants that are likely to be **available soon** include:

- Culver's root (Veronicastrum virginicum)
- Field pussytoes (Antennaria neglecta)
- Grass-leaved goldenrod (Euthamia graminifolia)
- Harebell/Scotch bellflower (Campanula rotundifolia)
- Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans)

## "Where is your nursery located? When can I visit?"

We do not currently have a storefront. Currently we are selling plants in two ways: 1) at markets and events, and 2) by order for pickup. 

## "Okay, so what's your next event?"

The next event is the **Newton Farmers' Market: Tuesday, September 17, 2024, from 1:30pm to 6pm in Cold Spring Park (1094 Beacon St.) in Newton, MA.** This market is part of the Grow Native Massachusetts' popup market series, and we'll be joined by three other native plant nurseries.

The Ashby Farmers Market will follow on Sunday, September 22, 2024, from 9am to noon on the Ashby Town Common (1 South Rd) in Ashby, MA. 

Generally speaking, during the season (May-October) season we plan to be at 2-4 markets a month -- primarily the Leominster and Ashby, MA Farmers' Markets. Look for the bright red popup tent!

Individual Market Details:

- **[Leominster Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/share/grDesndrVVMieN63/)**: 1st Saturday of the month through October, in Monument Square, Leominster, MA, from 11am to 2pm. We plan to be there 7/6, 8/3, 9/7, and 10/5 of 2024.
- **[Ashby Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/share/SnB5rWmko16gFejE/):** 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month through October, on the Ashby Town Common (1 South Rd), Ashby, MA, from 9am to noon. I plan to be there 7/14, 7/28, 8/11, 8/25, 9/8, 9/22, 10/13, and 10/27 of 2024.

If you use Facebook, you can indicate your interest in the events using the links above.

We have decided to no longer do the Fitchburg Farmers' Market due audience/market misalignment. 

Moving into the fall, we are scheduled to do the following popup markets with [Grow Native Massachusetts](https://grownativemass.org/): 
- **Newton Farmers' Market,** Tuesday, September 17, 2024, from 1:30pm to 6:30pm, in Cold Spring Park, Newton MA.
- **Lexington Farmers' Market:** Tuesday. October 1, 2024, from 2pm to 6:30pm, at Worthen Road Practice Field, Lexington, MA.

## "How do I order for pickup?"

If you're interested in purchasing any available plants (see above), please email [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) with your requests. At this time, quantities are very limited. 

You can pickup at one of our markets, or at our home/nursery in Lunenburg. 

## "Can I reserve/pre-order plants?"

If the plant is on our ["What We're Growing for 2024"](/posts/whats-growing-2024/) list, then you may **reserve** plants. Please note, as always, that everything depends on the vagaries of growing plants, and we cannot 100% guarantee that we can get you that plant this year.

Given this, we don't require payment until we actually deliver the plant. It just wouldn't be fair to you otherwise!

## "What forms of payment do you accept?"

I accept cash, Venmo, and credit card (via Square).

## "Can I suggest plants for you to grow?"

Please do! We can't guarantee we'll grow them this year, but we'll definitely look into it for next.
