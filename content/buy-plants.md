_(Updated: October 6, 2025)_

As we do not have a storefront, the best way to purchase plants is to email us at [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) to arrange pickup at a local market or at our home in Lunenburg, MA. 

While we won't be doing any more markets this season, **plants are available for purchase up until we put them to bed for the season** (around the end of November). We cannot guarantee success if plants are planted after a hard freeze, however.

## Available Now

The following plants are currently available for purchase. [Please email us at lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) if you are interested in purchasing any.

Curious how many we have of each size and species? [View our detailed inventory here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FV7iCZJYFeVC55onCDUhkP_r6_sS_5j-vdgNPat4-bk/edit?usp=sharing)

### Annual Natives

~~Pints $4; 1.5 pint $7; quart or 2 quart $8~~ These plants are now **free**. Please take them off my hands!

- Eastern black nightshade (Solanum emulans or ptycanthum) - has some green berries on it. Ripe berries can be collected for seed or left for wildlife benefit. (Or a spooky Halloween decoration? IDK).
- Indian tobacco (Lobelia inflata) - these have rosettes of leaves but may not flower before winter. Ripe seeds, if produced, can be harvested for next year, left for wildlife benefit, or scattered in your landscape. 

### "Zoigls" and Singletons

"Zoigls" are imperfect, "factory second" plants. Usually this means that we can't identify them to species level. (This is what happens when you don't label your seeds well!)

These plants are now **free**. Please take them off my hands!

- *Mystery goldenrod (Solidago species; possibly wrinkled-leaved (S. rugosa) or giant (S. gigantea))* - going dormant

### Non-natives

We no longer grow non-natives for sale, but we have some perennial herbs left over from last year. These plants are now **free**. Please take them off my hands!

- Lemon Balm 'Mandarina' - large
- Peppermint - small
- Sage, Broadleaf - small
- Peppermint - small

We also have three small Christmas/Thanksgiving cacti (houseplants) available for sale at $2.
