_(Updated: July 2, 2024)_

Since we are so new, buying plants from us is a little different! Please **read the full details** before emailing us your order/reservation. 

## "What do you currently have available?"

Here's the list. Note that these are mostly **plug-sized plants**, in ~3.5"-4" (1 pint) containers. We also have a few quart-sized containers available at this time.

### Native annuals
- [Partridge pea](/info-sheets/cha-fas/) - Chamaecrista fasciculata - $7 for 2 plants in a quart pot. Only 1 left!

### "Zoigls" - $3 pint or 2 for $5

"Zoigl" originally referred to a specific style of home-brewn, unfiltered German beer with no shelf life. It's also used to describe a beer that didn't quite come out as expected, and thus isn't suitable for wide distribution -- a "factory second," if you will. 

What does this have to do with native plants? Well, we have some plants that didn't quite come out as planned, or that we can't identify to species level. We're marking these down to $3 per pot, or 2 for $5 -- the same price as our non-natives.

- _Monarda?_ These seeds were labeled Monarda punctata (spotted bee-balm), but have produced plants that look more like Monarda fistulosa (wild bee-balm or wild bergamot). I'll know when they flower, but in the meantime, you can get a discount on a lovely native that -- regardless of species -- has sweet-scented leaves and flowers.
- _Symphyotrichum cordifolium (blue wood aster; heart leaved aster) or Eurybia divaricata? (white wood aster)_ These are from seeds I collected last year, but I didn't key out the plant when it was flowering. All I know they are asters, i.e. from one of the genera that used to be lumped into genus _Aster_, before it was split into 10 different genera(!) With only leaves to go on, I can't tell them apart (nor can iNaturalist!) Either way, both are native species that produce a white or whitish-blue flower in late summer or early fall (when many other flowers are beginning to fade), and thrive in very similar conditions (partial shade with medium to medium-dry soil). Until they flower, benefit from my mistake!
- _Milkweeds (Asclepias)_. These were given to me to sell, with the caveat that they were either swamp milkweed (A. incarnata) or common milkweed (A. syriaca), but the person didn't know which.  

### Non-native perennials - <strike>$4 each</strike> $3 each or 2 for $5
- Lavender ('Munstead')
- Lemon Balm - 'Mandarina' (it really smells like oranges!)
- Sage - Broadleaf
- Peppermint
- Catnip
- Thyme (English)
- Rosemary
- Lavender

### Non-native annuals - <strike>$3 each, or 2 for $5</strike> $2 each, or 3 for $5
- Bell Peppers - Grand Bell Mix and California Wonder varieties
- Tomatoes (slicing) - Super Beefsteak
- Tomatoes (sauce/cooking) - San Marzano, Roma
- Tomatoes (cherry) - Bicolor Cherry (pink/white at maturity), Sweetie (red), Chocolate Cherry (red/brown), Green Grape (green at maturity... and back in stock!)
- Habaneros
- Jalape√±os - Early
- Basil

## "What will you have available later in the year?"

Please refer to our ["What We're Growing for 2024"](/posts/whats-growing-2024/) post. Note that none of these are guarantees, because after a certain point, Mother Nature takes the wheel ü§£

Plants that are likely to be **available soon** include:

- Pearly everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea)
- Flax-leaved stiff aster (Ionactis linariifolia)
- Goat's rue (Tephrosia virginiana)
- Whorled milkweed (Asclepias verticillata)

- Solidago sp. (zoigl)
- Oenothera sp. (zoigl)

(Sadly our dill and cilantro has basically failed... so none of them this year).

## "Where is your nursery located? When can I visit?"

We do not currently have a storefront. Currently we are selling plants in two ways: 1) at markets and events, and 2) by order for pickup. 

## "Okay, so what's your next event?"

Generally speaking, during the season (May-October) season we plan to be at 2-4 markets a month -- primarily the Leominster, Fitchburg, and Ashby, MA Farmers' Markets. Look for the bright red popup tent!

Individual Market Details:

- **[Leominster Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/share/grDesndrVVMieN63/)**: 1st Saturday of the month through October, in Monument Square, Leominster, MA, from 11am to 2pm. We plan to be there 7/6, 8/3, 9/7, and 10/5 of 2024.
- **[Fitchburg Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/share/r7U6z7u5CSRHxWam/):** 2nd Saturday of the month through October, in the Upper Common, Fitchburg, MA, from 10am to 1pm. I plan to be there 7/13, 8/10, 9/14, and 10/12.
- **[Ashby Farmers' Market](https://www.facebook.com/share/SnB5rWmko16gFejE/):** 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month through October, on the Ashby Town Common (1 South Rd), Ashby, MA, from 9am to noon. I plan to be there 7/14, 7/28 (tentative due to a possible family commitment), 8/11, 8/25, 9/8, 9/22, 10/13, and 10/27 of 2024.

If you use Facebook, you can indicate your interest in the events using the links above.

As we move into the fall months, we will probably do more markets with [Grow Native Massachusetts](https://grownativemass.org/), as well. 

## "How do I order for pickup?"

If you're interested in purchasing any available plants (see above), please email [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) with your requests. At this time, quantities are very limited. 

You can pickup at one of our markets, or at our home in Lunenburg. 

## "Can I reserve/pre-order plants?"

If the plant is on our ["What We're Growing for 2024"](/posts/whats-growing-2024/) list, then you may **reserve** plants. Please note, as always, that everything depends on the vagaries of growing plants, and we cannot 100% guarantee that we can get you that plant this year.

Given this, we don't require payment until we actually deliver the plant. It just wouldn't be fair to you otherwise!

## "What forms of payment do you accept?"

I accept cash, Venmo, and now credit cards! (via Square).

## "Why so few plants?"

Here's the thing. We miscalculated. We winter sowed a lot of our plants, not realizing this meant they wouldn't emerge until May. As far as natives go, this means that right now we only have plants that we sowed indoors. We will have more, but it will be later in the season. 

But good news: 90% of the plants we grow are perennials, so even if you buy them in September or October, they'll still give you many years of joy. Even our annuals tend to be the self-seeding variety. 

We also probably overdid it on the non-natives. (Help I'm drowning in habaneros).

We're also really struggling with milkweeds (in particular common and butterfly milkweed), which are supposed to be easy to grow? I have no idea. They develop true leaves, but then the leaves will turn yellow, then brown, then die, even while the roots seem fine. 

In short... this is our first year in business, and we're still learning. Please be patient with the process üôÇ

## "Can I suggest plants for you to grow?"

Please do! We can't guarantee we'll grow them this year, but we'll definitely look into it.
