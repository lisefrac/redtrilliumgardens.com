### "Zoigls" and Singletons

"Zoigls" are imperfect, "factory second" plants. Usually this means that we can't identify them to species level. (This is what happens when you don't label your seeds well!)

Singletons plants are 2024 plants where we only have one of a species left.

- Black-eyed Susan F2 hybrid - grown from seed collected from 'Goldsturm' black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta x fulgida) - $3/pint

### Non-natives

We no longer grow non-natives for sale, but we have some perennial herbs left over from last year that we're offering at a deep discount.

$2 for a small plant (8oz cup to 1.5-pint); $6 for a large (2 quarts)

- Chives - small
- Lavender 'Munstead' - small
- Lemon Balm 'Mandarina' - large
- Peppermint - small
- Sage, Broadleaf - small

We also have three small Christmas/Thanksgiving cacti available for sale at $2.
