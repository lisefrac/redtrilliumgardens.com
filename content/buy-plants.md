### "Zoigls" and Singletons

"Zoigls" are imperfect, "factory second" plants. Usually this means that we can't identify them to species level. (This is what happens when you don't label your seeds well!)

Singletons are 2024 plants where we only have one of a species left.

- Hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum) singleton - $7 for a 2-quart

- White wood aster (Eurybia divaricata) singleton - $4/pint

### Non-natives

We no longer grow non-natives for sale, but we have some perennial herbs left over from last year that we're offering at a deep discount.

$2 for a small plant (8oz cup to 1.5-pint); $6 for a large (2 quarts)

- Chives - small
