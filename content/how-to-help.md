Want to help out, but:

- Don't have a place to put your own plants, or don't need any more?
- Don't live in New England, so your native plants are different than mine?
- Don't live close enough to our nursery/markets?
- Want to support us during the winter, when we aren't bringing in (much) revenue?

If so, here are some ways to help out our mission without taking home a plant yourself.

## Ko-fi 

Ko-fi is a platform for supporting individual artists and creators. It's analogous to Patreon, but with less sketchy business practices. In addition to allowing you to give a one-time donation, it also has a monthly contribution system. This allows us to keep going during difficult months (good for us), AND offers you rewards for donating (good for you). Rewards vary from access to the RTG Discord (at $3/month) all the way up to a 10% discount on all purchases (at $15/month).

And even if you can't support us financially right now, I'm going to try to post some extra content there, eg. photos. You can gain access to this free of charge simply by clicking the "Follow" button at the top of our About page.

## Help us in the nursery or at markets

Setting up at markets is really a two-person job, but I often have to do it alone. The help of superfans would appreciated here!

The commitment for a market is usually 4-5 hours (2-3 hour market plus setup/breakdown time), plus driving time. Sometimes it's on a weekend; sometimes it's midweek. In the warm season, we try to attend 2-3 markets a month. Many are them are close to the nursery in Lunenburg, MA, but some are as far away as Newton, Lexington, or Framingham, MA. 

At the nursery, I also often require help up-potting my seedlings in the spring/early summer. This is a variable time commitment, and I can do this on either weekdays or weekends.

Email [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) if you're interested in assisting in this way.

## Buy something from our wishlist

**Anyone who purchases $15 or more from our wishlist will receive a free small plant of their choice when we open in spring 2025.**

(Gift cards for any of the businesses listed below are also very welcome!)
