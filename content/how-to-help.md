Want to help out? While we try to reuse and repurpose as much as we can, there are still supplies that we have to source externally. That's where you come in! 

**Anyone who purchases $15 or more will receive a free small plant of their choice when we open in spring 2024.**

(Gift cards for any of the businesses listed below are also very welcome!)

Please reach out to **lise AT redtrilliumgardens DOT com** to arrange shipping or pickup.
