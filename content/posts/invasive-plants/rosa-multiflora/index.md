[Multiflora rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_multiflora) -- whose Latin name is _Rosa multiflora_, logically enough -- is kind of a **shit rose**.

It is native to east Asia, but definitely not North America, where it has become wildly invasive.

... if you know me at all, you know I have a bee in my bonnet about the term "invasive," but my definition of a shitty invasive is **"can I find it naturalized in woodlands behind my house?"**

And indeed I can. Especially in reclaimed areas, you can find thickets of it and Asiatic bittersweet (_Celastrus orbiculatus_) intertwined, choking out native plants and doing its shitty best to give me the 3.476 thorn scratches I am required to display after every walk through woods.

**Why the heck is it even in this country?** It is yet another example of "let's bring in a non-native plant to help with an ecological problem.... WELL I GUESS THAT BACKFIRED." The problem was soil erosion; now you have the problem that is UP TO MY EYEBALLS IN SHIT ROSES.

You see it a lot in reclaimed farmlands, where it was used extensively as a cattle brake. Why? This might surprise you, but it turns out that cows don't like running face first into a wall of thorns.

**This is the Wei.** My mom had a Chinese exchange student named Wei (first tone, straight line over the "i" in Pinyin). We were trying to figure out what her name translated to; she knew it was a type of flower but she didn't know the translation in English. So she asked Chinese-language Google, and lo and behold, it means "multiflora rose."

... it's an awkward conversation to tell someone they share a name with an invasive species. Usually I only have those conversations with leshy in my Pathfinder games.

**The way to tell multiflora rose apart from other, less shit roses?** Well, for one thing its influorescence is a cluster of individual flowers. ("Influorescence" is botany speak for "flower or group of flowers"). They are usually white, too, and there are lots of them on a single branch.

But my favorite ONE WEIRD TRICK to identifying multiflora rose? The petiole (leaf stalk) looks like a feather:

In conclusion: multiflora rose: unless you have cattle, absolutely no good will come of having this in your yard.
