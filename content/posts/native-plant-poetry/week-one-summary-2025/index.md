*Wonder what Native Plant Poetry Month is? [See my explanation here.](updates/mar-28-2025)* 

We wrapped up week one of Native Plant Poetry month with three poems from poets past and present on three different native plants!

## Day 1: "The Blue-Flag in the Bog"

Our first poem for Native Plant Poetry month was Millay's ["The Blue-Flag in the Bog,"](https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/millay/april/sa-bog.html) which celebrates the Iris versicolor (blue-flag iris), one of our native irises.

> All my heart became a tear,
> 
>   All my soul became a tower,
> 
> Never loved I anything
> 
>   As I loved that tall blue flower!

(Note: I'm you to the public Ko-fi post for links to the poem, info about the plant, and other goodies. However, Ko-fi absolutely butchers images when they are uploaded. The best version will be the one here).

## Day 2: "Mountain Laurel"

Today's we celebrate mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), [via the poem of the same name by Kasey Jueds, published in EcoTheo Collective. ](https://www.ecotheo.org/etreview/mountain-laurel)

> Even never having seen
> 
> mountain laurel in June, try
> to hold it close: near dark, a trembling
> 
> of tiny lamps, candling the wished-upon
> hours.

> No Angelus, except the wild bird's lay,
> 
> Awakes these forest nuns; yet night and day
> 
> Their heads are bent, as if in prayerful mood.
