(you know me, I can't turn down the opportunity for a bad joke in my title)

Before you squish that ant you find crawling on your native plant, consider this: **ants play a vital role in a native plant ecosystem.**

How? Read on! 

## Myrmecochory

"Myrmecochory" is just a fancy word for "seed dispersal by ants." This is common in a number of different native plants, especially Liliopsida, the monocots. As an example, both trilliums (genus Trillium) and native spiderworts (genus Tradescantia) depend on ants to disperse their seeds.

This is an example of a mutualism, where each party -- both ant and plant -- benefit from the exchange. The seeds of these plants have evolved to produce a fatty... chunk on the exterior of the seed. This lipid-rich elaiosome is delicious to ants, who will seek it out as soon as the fruit becomes ripe. (Indeed, if you are trying to collect seeds from these plants, you'll need to beat the ants to them!)

After the delicious part has been eaten, ants carry these seeds back to their middens -- basically, their trash pile outside the nest. From there, new seeds can germinate!

(So just think -- any time you see a trillium, it's probably growing on top of ant garbage!)
