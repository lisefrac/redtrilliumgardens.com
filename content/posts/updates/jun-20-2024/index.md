Can you believe it's already June -- and almost July? April felt interminable ("the cruelest month"; thanks T.S. Eliot), May had a slow start, but June has flown by. Maybe because it's the busiest time of the year! 

... My entire life right now is potting up plants that I winter sowed; pls halp.

Speaking of winter sowing, finally some of our winter sown plants are big enough to sell! We also had a generous donation of plants from a friend of the nursery, Ginny, who has been a huge supporter since day 1. Most of those will need to be repotted as well, but a few are ready to sell as-is.

## Available Now

In case you missed it, the following plants just became available:

- **[Ageratina altissima - white snakeroot]({{% relref "/posts/native-plants/ageratina-altissima/"%}})**
- **[Asclepias syriaca](/info-sheets/asclepias-syriaca/)** - common milkweed ‚ù§Ô∏è At long last! It fought us, but we won. I think it was a problem of overwatering. I need to practice more benign neglect with these bebbies. (It also helps that we had a donation of these from Ginny!)
- **Cirsium discolor** - pasture thistle (2 qt pots). This was another donation from Ginny. 
- **Lobelia cardinalis** - Cardinal flower. This is a late summer favorite of mine. But then, I do love red!
- **Oenothera biennis** - Common evening primrose - this one is a biennial or short-lived perennial, so get it while it's small for earlier blooms.
- **Symphyotrichum laeve** - Smooth blue aster
- **Symphyotrichum cordifolium** - Blue wood aster/heart-leaved aster

We also newly have 1 or 2 quart pots of **yarrow** (Achillea millefolium) and **wild bergamot** (Monarda fistulosa), available for $9/each. 

We also have of other native plants, tomatoes, hot (and not-so-spicy) peppers, and herbs. [Full availability list here]({{% relref "/buy-plants/" %}}).

And if you're looking for discounted plants, may I point you to our  ["zoigls?"]({{% relref "/buy-plants" %}}) We also have our [pot rebate program]({{% relref "/buy-plants#pot-rebate-program" %}}) -- you'll receive 10 cents off your purchase for each pot in good condition that you return to the nursery (down to a minimum purchase of $5; must be applied on that purchase). One pint, one quart, and two quart pots are especially in demand right now. 

Please see our instructions for buying plants right [here]({{% relref "/buy-plants/" %}})! If you can't make it to one of our markets, you can always pick up in person at our nursery (read: home) in Lunenburg, MA.

## Next Market(s)

So, this is awkward. We have applied to the Fitchburg and Leominster Farmers Markets, but have not yet heard back from them (despite repeated follow-ups). But the next markets are fast approaching -- July 6th for Leominster and July 7th for Fitchburg!

Worst case scenario, I'm just going to show up the day of and see if they let me set-up ü§£ If not, I'll plan to be at Montuori Fleamarket July 20th.

In brief:

- (TENTATIVE) Leominster Farmers' Market - July 6, 2024, 11am - 2pm - either Monument Square or City Hall parking lot in Leominster, MA
- (TENTATIVE) Fitchburg Farmers' Market - July 13, 2024, 10am - 1pm - Upper Common, Fitchburg, MA
- (TENTATIVE) Montuori Fleamarket - July 20, 2024 - 9am - 1pm - 186 Massachusetts Ave, Lunenburg, MA

Hope to see you there!
