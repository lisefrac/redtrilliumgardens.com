## Fall Native Plant Sale

Save the date! **We'll be doing our end of season native plant sale Sun, Oct 5th, 2025, from 10am-4pm in Lunenburg, MA**. 

Anyone who attends will receive a $5 off coupon valid in 2026!

What can you expect?

- Since this is a public event, please [email me](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) for the address, so I know you're a real person and not an internet rando.
- This is a rain or shine event. Only severe weather (heavy thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, sharknadoes) will cancel it.
- While some plants, like asters and goldenrods, will still be going strong, many plants are going dormant and aren't looking their best.
- Our dormant plants will be on discount, as well as any annuals we haven't sold. (Even past annuals can support wildlife through the fall and winter, providing food and habitat).
- You should still have plenty of time to plant perennials before winter hits! Note that they may die back once you put them in the ground, but they should bounce back beautifully in the spring.
- If you use Facebook, [you can RSVP to the event.](https://www.facebook.com/share/14E1z14MT6T/) This is great for boosting the event by providing social proof to other users.

I hope to see you there!

## Two-fer markets this weekend

We'll be at TWO markets this weekend -- both the Groton Farmers' Market and the Montuori (Lunenburg) Fleamarket. (If only because I need to get out of the house!)

The end of the season is fast approaching, so get your plants while you can! We'll have:

- asters and goldenrods for fall blooms!
- annuals that are still popping (like Indian tobacco)!
- plants for blooms next year (like foxglove beardtongue)

... and more!

Details:
- Groton Farmers' Market: Fri 9/12/25, 3-7pm, 160 Chicopee Row, Groton, MA
- Montuori: Sun 9/14/25, 9am-2pm, 186 Massachusetts Ave., Lunenburg, MA

As always, you can reserve plants to be picked up at one of our markets. More information about species availability can be found on the [Buy Plants page](/buy-plants/). You can email me at lise@redtrilliumgardens.com with your order.
