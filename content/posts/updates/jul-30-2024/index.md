As some of you may already be aware, I sprained my ankle this past Saturday. It's minor -- x-rays confirmed there's no fracture -- but it's making it difficult to get around, especially to the level I need for gardening and doing markets. As a result, I had to cancel my market on Sunday (Ashby Farmers' Market).

I am *scheduled* to do the Leominster Farmers' Market next Saturday -- August 3rd, 2024 11am-2pm in Monument Square. But a lot depends on how I feel on Friday. If I'm not moving well enough to do my market prep, then I *definitely* won't be able to do the market. I also don't have assistance this weekend, which would make everything easier. 

If you want to offer your assistance, that would seriously increase the chance of my actually being able to attend!

Otherwise, I'll keep you posted. The best place to get up-to-the-minute updates on market attendances or cancellations is [on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/redtrilliumgardens/).
