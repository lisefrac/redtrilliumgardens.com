Our first market of the season is happening tomorrow, Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025.

We've teamed up with Grow Native Massachusetts to do another pop-up native plant market at Fitchburg MA's Earth Day celebration. 

We'll be in parking lot of Fitchburg City Hall (730 Main Street) from 2-5pm with a selection of our native plants:

- Foxglove beardtongue (Penstemon digitalis) - quarts at $10
- [Clustered mountain-mint (Pycnanthemum muticum)](/info-sheets/pycnanthemum-muticum/) - quarts at $10
- [Sundial lupine (Lupinus perennis)](/info-sheets/lupinus-perennis/) - 1.5 pint - $8
- [Wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa)](/info-sheets/monarda-fistulosa/) - 1 pint - $6
- [Partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata)](/info-sheets/cha-fas/) (annual) - 1.5 pint - $7

We'll also have a milkweed planting activity for kids of all ages. Plant a pot of common milkweed seeds and take it home with you!
