We'll be at two markets this week, on Thursday and Saturday.

## Brookline Farmers' Market

The first is the **Brookline Farmers' Market** on Thursday, September 4, 2025, from 1:30pm to 6:30pm in the Centre Street West Parking Lot. 

This is one of Grow Native Massachusetts' pop-up markets, so I'll be joined by [Lady Fern Farm](https://ladyfernfarm.com/) and [Checkerspot Farm](https://www.checkerspotfarm.com/). We're coordinating our inventory to bring you the widest variety of plants!

Currently, here's what I'm planning to bring:

- Ageratina altissima (Symphyotrichum cordifolium)
- Asclepias syriaca (Pycnanthemum muticum)
- Boehmeria cylindrica (Eutrochium dubium)
- Chamaecrista fasciculata (Asclepias syriaca)
- Clematis virginiana (Solidago puberula)
- Corydalis sempervirens (Penstemon digitalis)
- Doellingeria umbellata (Zizia aurea)
- Echinacea pallida (Euthamia graminifolia)
- Liatris novae-angliae (Zizia aptera)
- Lobelia inflata (Polemonium reptans)
- Mentha arvensis (Schizachyrium scoparium)
- Physocarpus opulifolius (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae)
- Physostegia virginiana (Liatris novae-angliae)
- Polanisia dodecandra (Vernonia noveboracensis)
- Polemonium reptans (Physostegia virginiana)
- Pycnanthemum muticum (Echinacea pallida)
- Pycnanthemum virginianum (Asclepias exaltata)
- Solidago sempervirens (Echinacea purpurea)
- Symphyotrichum cordifolium (Aquilegia canadensis)
- Vernonia noveboracensis (Asclepias incarnata)

Starting at this market, some annuals whose blooms have past will be **discounted to $3 for a pint and $5 for a 1.5 pint container**. They still provide benefit to wildlife, however, and there is also a strong chance that if you plant them now, they will self-sow in your garden next year! (Partridge pea in particular is **notorious** for this!)

## Leominster Farmers' Market

On Saturday, September 6, 2025 we'll be at our usually scheduled **Leominster Farmers' Market** from 11am to 2pm, in Monument Square in downtown Leominster, MA.

We'll have the same list of species as Brookline, plus (if we have room!) we'll have our steeply discounted perennial herbs (non-natives). 

Please see our recently-updated [Buy Plants page](/buy-plants/) for a full list of what species we have available. As always, you can reserve plants for pickup at either of these markets -- email your order to lise@redtrilliumgardens.com.

Hope to see you there!

## Future Markets

The following markets are also coming up in September and October:

- **The Farmers' Market at Forest Park**. With Grow Native Massachusetts. Tuesday, September 30th, 12:30pm to 6pm, at 300 Sumner Avenue in Springfield, MA.
- **Leominster Farmers' Market**. The final market of the season is October 4, 2025, 11am-2pm, in Monument Square in Leominster, MA. 
- **Gardner Farmers' Market**. Saturday, October 18, 2025, from 9:30am to 1pm at the Waterford Street School in Gardner, MA.

And save the (tentative) date for our **end of season sale** at our backyard nursery in Lunenburg, MA. We're thinking Sunday, October 19, 2025, from 10am to 4pm. Stay tuned for updates on this date!

And then we'll close for the season! Ssshhh the plants are trying to sleep ðŸ¤£
