Guess what April is?

... no, not my birth month. (Although, good guess!) It's **[National Poetry Month](https://poets.org/national-poetry-month) AND [National Native Plant Month](https://nationalnativeplantmonth.org/)!**

What better way to celebrate than to feature the work of **American/Canadian poets who write about native plants?**

Details:

- I'm sticking with the **native plants of the northeast US and Canada**, because they're what I know best. 
- This will be a series of **social media posts** on the Red Trillium Gardens [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redtrilliumgardens/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/redtrilliumgardens) -- with echoes on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/redtrilliumgardens.bsky.social).
- I can't promise a daily post -- that's a lot! -- but I'll try to bring you 2-3 a week. 
- Each social media post will feature **one poem from one poet (historical or modern) about one plant.** You'll get quotes from the poem along with photos of the plant in question (see below for an example). 
- **Become a [Ko-fi supporter](https://ko-fi.com/redtrilliumgardens/tiers) of the nursery -- for as low as $3/month -- and gain early access to each post!**

In the foreground is a quote from Douglas Tallamy in Nature's Best Hope: 'Gardening in the traditional sense is optional, but earth stewardship is not'">}}

Some of the poems/plants we're planning to showcase are:

- "The Blue-Flag in the Bog" - Edna St. Vincent Millay - Iris versicolor
- "The Yellow Violet" - William Cullen Bryant - Viola pubescens
- "Trilliums" - Mary Oliver - Trillium grandiflorum
- "Ghost Flower" - Mary Thacher Higginson - Monotropa uniflora
- "May Flower" - Emily Dickinson - Epigaea repens (trailing arbutus)
- "The Rhodora" - Ralph Waldo Emerson - Rhododendron canadense
- "I’uni Kwi Athi? Hiatho" - Roberta Hill Whiteman - Corylus spp. (hazelnut)
- "Mountain Laurel" - Kasey Jueds - Kalmia latifolia
- "Decaedom: A Spell for Wild Cherry (Prunus serotina)” - Alison Granucci
- "Marcescence" - Denton Loving - Fagus grandifolia (American beech)
- "Red" - Cheryl Savageau - Acer spp. (maple)
- "Silver Maple, Solstice" - Julie E. Bloemeke - Acer saccharinum

... and more? We'll see what I can manage while also prepping the nursery for spring!

I also intend to use this post as the central repository for information about the poem and the plant -- links to the whole poem, image attribution, info about the plant, etc. I'll update this as posts are released. 

I hope you'll follow along!
