## Next Markets

We'll be at both the Leominster and Ashby markets this weekend. More markets means more chances to get our plants! Details:

- [Leominster Farmers' Market:](https://www.facebook.com/events/1193939304976811/1202332724137469/?active_tab=about) Saturday, September 7th, 2024, from 11am-2pm in Monument Square, Leominster, MA
- [Ashby Farmers Market:](https://www.facebook.com/events/731875628951448/731875658951445?active_tab=about) Sunday, September 8th, 2024, from 9am to noon on the Ashby Town Common (1 South Rd), Ashby, MA.

Our theme for these markets is "In Bloom ðŸŒ¸" -- we plan to bring whatever species are showing off beautiful flowers (or are about to!) That includes:

- Cardinal flower [(Lobelia cardinalis)]({{% relref "/info-sheets/lobelia-cardinalis/" %}})
- Blue wood aster [(Symphyotrichum cordifolium)]({{% relref "/info-sheets/symphyotrichum-cordifolium/" %}})
- Smooth blue aster [(Symphyotrichum laeve)]({{% relref "/info-sheets/symphyotrichum-laeve/" %}})
- White snakeroot [(Ageratina altissima)]({{% relref "posts/native-plants/ageratina-altissima/" %}}) - in 2 quart pots for $10
- Wild mint (Mentha arvensis)
- Wreath/bluestem goldenrod (Solidago caesia)

We also plan to have:

- Common bur sedge (Carex grayi)
- Common evening primrose [(Oenothera biennis)]({{% relref "/info-sheets/oenothera-biennis/" %}})
- Common ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius)
- Foxglove beardtongue (Penstemon digitalis)
- Golden alexanders (Zizia aurea)
- Kalm's St. John's wort (Hypericum kalmianum)
- New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae)
- Northern beardtongue (Penstemon hirsutus)
- Pennsylvania sedge (Carex pensylvanica)
- Yarrow, multi-hued cultivar [(Achillea millefolium)]({{% relref "/info-sheets/achillea-millefolium-multihued-cultivar/" %}})

... and probably others I'm forgetting! 

We're also bringing some discounted annuals. These have already flowered and are setting fruit/seeds. They are still great for seed collection, however, and may also self-seed in the landscape. Of course, they're also worth planting for the wildlife benefit of their fruits and seeds!

- American black nightshade (Solanum ptycanthum) - <strike>$4</strike> $2 for a pint pot. It's still worth planting to support wildlife throughout the fall and winter, as the fruits support many species of birds, including wild turkey, ruffed grouse, and catbirds!
- [Partridge pea]({{% relref "/info-sheets/cha-fas/" %}})- Chamaecrista fasciculata - <strike>$7</strike> $4 for 2 plants in a quart pot. The seeds are enjoyed by bobwhite quail, ring-necked pheasants, mallards, and small mammals, among others. (Probably partridges -- ruffed grouse -- too?)

Our [Buy Plants]({{% relref "/buy-plants/" %}}) page is up to date. If you would like to order plants to be picked up at the market, email us at [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) by Friday evening (Sep 6th) to make sure we bring your plants!

As ever, perennial pints are $5 and quart or two quart containers are $10. We accept cash, Venmo, and credit card.

Hope to see you at one of these markets!

Not sure if it's the native Pennsylvania smartweed (Persicaria pensylvanica) or the Chinese variety (Persicaria chinensis), and iNaturalist couldn't narrow it down any further. GoBotany leads me to think it's the latter, due to the winged petioles(?) that clasp the stem. But as always with dichotomous keys, they're hard to decode, especially if you haven't seen a real-life example before. (And more so if you're working from a photo!)*
