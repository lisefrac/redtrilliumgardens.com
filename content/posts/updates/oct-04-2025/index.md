(Good thing you didn't have to hear me sing that). 

Anyway! Here at the nursery, we have hundreds of native perennials just waiting to be put in the ground. **And tomorrow (Sunday), Oct 5, 2025, 10am-4pm, is our biggest sale of, maybe, ever?**

What will we have? [Our entire inventory!](/buy-plants/)! This includes fall perennials like:

- New England aster
- White wood aster
- Smooth blue aster
- Seaside goldenrod
- Grass-leaved goldenrod
- Bluestem/wreath goldenrod

Perennials to plan(t) for next year, such as:
- Northern beardtongue

- Red columbine

Grasses/sedges/rushes, such as:

... and soooo much more!

Plus, all of our dormant plants (which includes all milkweeds) are discounted, and there will be a number of mystery/"please take these" free plants available. 

Best of all, **everyone who makes a purchase will receive a $5 off coupon for next year!**
Please [email me](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) for the precise address. As the nursery is also my home, I just want to make sure you're a real person and not a bot ❤️

Hope to see you there!
