- **We now have socials!** If you haven't already, please give us a like/follow on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556070398055) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redtrilliumgardens/).
- **We also now have an [email newsletter](/newsletter)!** It sends on Tues, Thurs, and Sat evenings if there's a new blog post to show. Right now we're averaging about 1 email a week. 
- **We have hired [RaigeMage](https://raigemage.artstation.com/) to make a more professional logo and header for us.** I'm excited by what I've seen so far, and I'm excited to see the final result!
- ICYMI: I answered the number one most common question I get about this business: **["what is a native plant?"](/posts/what-is-a-native-plant)** Hopefully I did the topic justice!
- **We've planted at least one batch of all of the seeds we have!** Which means I'm now planting additional batches. Also...
- **I bought more seeds** (surprise, surprise), from both Wild Seed Project and Prairie Moon. They include:
  - Zizia aurea (golden alexander)
  - Zizia aptera (heart-leaved alexander)
  - Anaphalis margaritacea (pearly everlasting)

  - Symphyotrichum cordifolium (blue wood aster)
  - Symphyotrichum laeve (smooth blue aster)
  - Apocynum cannabinum (hemp dogbane)
  - Desmodium canadense (showy tick trefoil)
  - Mentha arvensis (wild mint)
  - Oenothera biennis (common evening primrose)
  - Lycopus americanus (water horehound)
  - Linaria canadensis (blue toadflax)
  - Pycnanthemum incanum (hoary mountain mint)
  - Agrimonia striata (roadside agrimony)
  - Asclepias verticillata (whorled milkweed)

That's it for now! I'm working on a native plant showcase post about white snakeroot (*Ageratina altissima*), which I hope to bring you soon. I've also shot some videos of my "Plant Dungeon" which I hope to bring you at some point!
