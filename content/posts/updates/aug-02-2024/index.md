... sorrynotsorry.

Leominster Farmers' Market<br />
Saturday, Aug 3, 2024, 11am-2pm<br />
Monument Square, Leominster, MA

What we plan to have ($5 in a pint pot unless otherwise marked):

- Monarch food! i.e. milkweeds (Asclepias spp) 🦋 (literally; the monarchs and milkweed tussock caterpillars have been devouring these!)
- "Get ready for fall" plants like
asters (Symphyotrichum, Eurybia, Doellingeria spp) and goldenrods (Solidago spp) 🍁
- "Hummingbird quartet" in vibrants reds and pinks: native penstemons (Penstemon digitalis and hirsutus), cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis), and red columbine (Aquilegia canadensis) 🐦‍🔥
- Partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata) - $7 for a quart pot of two plants (annual) - now in bloom! 🌼

We will also have some non-native annuals on DEEP discount -- San Marzano tomatoes, habaneros, bell peppers, jalapeños, and basil. 6 for $5; please take them off my hands! 🍅🌶️🌿

... and even more!

Reminder that you can reserve plants to be picked up at the market! If there's anything on the [Buy Plants! page](/buy-plants/) that appeals to you, [email me at lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) and I'll make sure it's ready for you.

See you there!
