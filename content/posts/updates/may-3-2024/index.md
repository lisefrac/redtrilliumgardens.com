We changed our site description, so it's official -- we're now open for business!

## "When can I visit?"

As we don't have a storefront, currently we are selling plants in two ways: 1) at markets and events, and 2) by order for pickup. 

## "What's your next event?"

We are planning to attend these two events:

- Framingham Spring Fest, May 4, 2024, at Downtown Common, 2 Park Street, Framingham, MA, 12pm-4pm. ([Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/4vCfpKSWJ))
- Montuori Flea Market, May 11, 2024, 186 Mass Ave in Lunenburg, MA. Hours are approximate, but we anticipate being set up by 9am at latest and we'll probably decamp by 2pm or so. [Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/1GotRIo4K).

Stay tuned for more dates! (You can always [join our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/redtrilliumgardens/), where we create events for all our markets).

## "How do I order for pickup?"

If you're interested in purchasing any available plants (see below), please email lise AT redtrilliumgardens DOT com with your requests. At this time, quantities are very limited. 

## "What do you have available?"

Here is what we currently have available. Note that these are plug-sized plants, mostly in 3.5"-4" containers. 

### Native perennials - $5 each

### "Why so few plants?"

Here's the thing. We miscalculated. We winter sowed a lot of our plants, not realizing this meant they'd just *now* be emerging. As far as natives go, this means that right now we only have plants that we sowed indoors. We will have more, but it will be later in the season. 

But good news: 90% of the plants we grow are perennials, so even if you buy them in September or October, they'll still give you many years of joy. 

We also probably overdid it on the non-natives -- especially given that they mostly don't require stratification! (Help I'm drowning in haba√±eros).

We're also really struggling with milkweeds (in particular common and butterfly milkweed), which are supposed to be easy to grow? I have no idea. They develop true leaves, but then the leaves will turn yellow, then brown, then die, even while the roots seem fine. 

In short... this is our first year in business, and we're still learning. Please be patient with the process üôÇ

For this reason, we probably won't schedule another event until June, when hopefully we'll have more stock. We're still hoping to set up biweekly at the Lunenburg Farmer's Market starting in June, but they somehow *still* have not sent out the application, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
