Hello native friends! And a very warm welcome to those folks who subscribed our newsletter at the Lunenburg Artisan Market!

## Next Market

Our next market is upon us: **[Davis Square Farmers Market](https://www.facebook.com/events/1209625696789433/?active_tab=discussion), Wednesday, May 21, 2025, from noon to 6pm**. The street address is 44 Day Street, Somerville MA, and you can [read more about the market here](https://www.massfarmersmarkets.org/davis).

This is a pop-up market hosted by [Grow Native Massachusetts](https://grownativemass.org/), and we're hoping it will be a lively one! In addition to our wares, we'll be joined by [Green Blossom Painting](https://www.facebook.com/GreenBlossomPainting/), [Tree Talk Natives](https://www.treetalknatives.com/), [Checkerspot Farm](https://www.checkerspotfarm.com/), and [Lady Fern Farm](https://ladyfernfarm.com/) (tentative). So drop by on your lunch break or after work and invest in some native plants!

We have not yet finalized our plant list for the sale, but we will be well stocked from the [updated list on our Buy Plants page](/buy-plants/). As always you can reserve plants to be picked up at the market -- email me at [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) if you see anything you can't live without.

Another note: **I could really use a helper for this event!** Helpers receive a steep discount on any plants they want to take home + I'll pay for their food. Plus, you know, the pleasure of my company, and all the native plant facts you could ever want!

The most difficult parts to manage by myself are setup (10:30am to noon) and takedown (6pm to 7pm). I'd also appreciate help during the market -- checking customers out, answering questions (most of which can be answered by the provided info sheets), and general traffic management. This may be more or less difficult depending on how the market goes -- I've never been to this one and I have no idea what to expect.

Someone who wants to do the whole event with me would be absolutely fantastic, but I'll take what help I can get!

## Pot/Stake Rebate

We are also resurrecting our **pot rebate program** from last year. To reduce plastic usage, we reuse pots as much as possible -- you may notice this if you shop at one of our markets! 

To this end, **anyone who brings us pots** in the sizes we currently use (pint, quart, and 2 quart) will receive a **discount** on their purchase in the following amounts:

Total purchase â‰¤ $10 = $2 off<br/>
Total purchase $20-49 = $4 off<br/>
Total purchase $50+ = $8 off

We will also offer a rebate for **pot stakes** for labeling our plants! We use the 5"x5/8" size. 

All materials should be in good condition (preferably cleaned) and of the type we request. The best option is to return pots/stakes you got from us -- that way we both know it's something we can use!
