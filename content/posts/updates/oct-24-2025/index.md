I'm settling in to seed collection and cleaning season here at the nursery, an activity which has left my fingers stained blue and my eyes straining (those summersweet seeds are *tiny*, yo). Things feel a bit calmer than the height of the season, but it's never too quiet around here...

## Help us grow taller!

Help us serve you better! **If you interacted with Red Trillium Gardens in 2025 -- even if you didn't make a purchase -- we'd love feedback on your experience.**

I've put together this **[feedback form](https://forms.gle/ewNhcrJX5ki8fi5RA)**, and I'd be honored if you took a few minutes to fill it out. Only five questions are required, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes to complete. 

I've enjoyed getting to know y'all this year, and I am truly grateful for your patronage and interaction. Here's to an even better 2026!

## Native Plant Studies certificate complete!

This week I sent Native Plant Trust confirmation of my **completion of the Native Plant Studies basic certificate**. 

I'd already confirmed that two years of running a native plant nursery  covered the community service requirement, so the last step was to put together my **portfolio**. Here's the cover image I used for the (actual, physical) portfolio:

{{<figure src="images/npt-cert-portfolio-cover.JPG" link="images/npt-cert-portfolio-cover.JPG" title="Did I need to make the fancy cover? I did not. But it was fun to do anyway. And those are all photos I took myself! Of course I had to include a red trillium!" alt="A grid of four photos of native plants, with the text: 'Native Plant Studies Basic Certificate - Portfolio for Elisabeth (Lise) Fracalossi">}}

I haven't heard back from Native Plant Trust yet, and honestly, I'm not sure what happens next. Do I get a neat diploma? Is there a graduation ceremony? Do I learn a secret handshake? **Do I receive a letter in the mail informing me I'm now legally a nerd?**

Personally, I'm hoping it's the latter.

Here are some more pictures from inside the portfolio:

Of course I write in cursive, a script indecipherable to people under the age of 30 😆" alt="Some notes from the Botany of the Connecticut Coast field study I did recently.">}}

Why did I decide to pursue the certificate? Obviously I don't need a piece of paper to legitimize my knowledge of native plants! Mostly I did it because I wanted to take the courses anyway, and I figured, hey, I might as well get some resume material out of it.

I began this process in late 2022, not long before my mother died, and it's been... a Time™️ in my life. A challenging one. It continues to be. But this, and the nursery, continue to be a source of joy and meaning for me.

**Thank you for being a part of this** ❤️
