We'll be at the Leominster MA Farmers' Market this Saturday, July 5th, 2025, from 11am to 2pm, in Monument Square, Leominster, MA.  

We'll have several lovely annuals and biennials **in bloom** -- all of which are new-this-year species for us! This includes:

- **Pale corydalis (Corydalis sempervirens; biennial 1st year).** This biennial offers delicate pale green foliage and small colorful pink and yellow flowers. 
- **Redwhisker Clammyweed (Polanisia dodecandra; annual).** A great name for an interesting plant! It's called "clammy weed" because supposedly handling the leaves will make your hands feel clammy. (I haven't noticed this). The flowers are small, but a striking pink/red color.  
- **Rattlebox (Crotalaria sagittalis; annual).** We only have one left of this member of the bean family with fall interest! The seed pods of this plant, when they dry, will rattle -- hence the name. 

We will have our usual selection of perennials as well -- see [Buy Plants](/buy-plants/) for the full list. As always with our markets, you can order plants for pickup at our markets by emailing me at [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com).

Hope to see you there! And if you miss us this weekend, we'll be at this market on the first Saturday of each month, ending in October.
