## Opening Day Sale!

We'll be officially open for business this **Sunday, May 4th, 2025, at our backyard nursery in Lunenburg, MA**. Stop by between 10am and 4pm that day to buy native plants, take a tour, and nerd out about botany!

If you're Facebook active, you can indicate "interested" or "going" on the [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/653131067297542), and that will keep you up to date.

Since I'd rather not have internet randos showing up on my doorstep, please email [lise@redtrilliumgardens.com](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) for the address.

Our overwintered plants are popping, so some of the things we expect to have available include:

- Goldenrods! Wreath/bluestem (Solidago caesia), seaside (S. sempervirens), and lots of mystery goldenrods.
- Asters! We have New England aster (Symphyotrichum novae-angliae), smooth blue aster (S. laeve), and tall white aster (Doellingeria umbellata). Oh, and a bunch of mystery wood asters, too.
- Boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum)
- Monarda! Including wild bee-balm/bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) and spotted bee-balm (M. punctata)
- Clustered/broad-leaved mountain-mint (Pycnanthemum muticum) and a few of other Pycnanthemum species.
- Cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis)
- Foxglove beardtongue (Penstemon hirsutus)
- Kalm's St. John's Wort (Hypericum kalmianum), a great native St. John's wort.
- Harebell (Campanula rotundifolia)
- Wild mint (Mentha arvensis)

... and quite a few more! We will also have a few singletons of overwintered plants, some leftover non-native garden herbs from last year (eg. bee balm, mint, sage), and Thanksgiving/Christmas cacti (houseplants).

General pricing for natives (exceptions may apply):

Perennial pints: $6<br />
Perennial 1.5 pint: $8<br />
Perennial quarts: $10<br />
Perennial 2 quart: $14<br />
Annual pint: $4<br />
Annual 1 or 2 quart: $8<br />

We accept cash, Venmo, and credit card.

## May Markets

This month we're planning to attend two markets:

- **[Lunenburg Artisan Market](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61558079260325)**, May 11, 2025, from 9am to 2pm. This is the same location as the Montuori Fleamarket (186 Massachusetts Ave, Lunenburg, MA), but this in particular is a grouping of local artisans. 
- **Davis Square Farmers Market**, Somerville, MA, Sunday, May 21, 1-4pm. This is another Grow Native Mass pop-up market, and we will be joined by [Green Blossom Painting](https://www.facebook.com/GreenBlossomPainting/), [Tree Talk Natives](https://www.treetalknatives.com/), [Checkerspot Farm](https://www.checkerspotfarm.com/), and possibly others!

And as a preview of June, look for our return to the Newton Farmers Market!
