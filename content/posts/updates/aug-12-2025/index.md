## What's in Bloom at the Nursery?

Mid- to late summer can be a questionable time in the garden, depending on how you've planted! There's a tendency to avoid planting in the summer, thinking that plants won't tolerate the heat. However, this can lead to a lull in color at this time of year -- especially if one only buys plants that are blooming!

Even we've got a bit of that going on right now! However, in amongst our pots for sale and our personal garden -- plus the woodlands of our property -- we've got pops of orange, yellow, and even purple.

Here are just a few:

## Gardner Farmers' Market

We've joined another market! We'll be at Gardner Farmers Market for two dates only this season -- Saturdays, August 16th and October 18th, 2025. The market runs from 9:30am to 1pm at the Waterford Street School in Gardner, MA. I've heard it's a bigger one, with 20+ vendors, both crafters and farmers. (Personally, I'm hoping to pick up some honey while I'm there!)

We'd love to see you there!
