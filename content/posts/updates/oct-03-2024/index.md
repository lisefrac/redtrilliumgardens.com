Ahhh it's the end of the season! I am only slightly losing my mind this week, preparing for my last market of the season, ordering seeds (can you believe Wild Seed Project was sold out of half the seeds I wanted by 10am on their opening day?), finishing my New England Shrubs class, and preparing for my open house on Sunday!

## Next and Final Market

Our final market is the **Leominster Farmers' Market, this Saturday, October 5th, 2024, from 11am-2pm, in Monument Square in Leominster, MA.** Please let us know ASAP if you would like to reserve any plants for pickup at the market -- see our [Buy Plants](/buy-plants/) page for ordering details.

## Open House

I am super excited to welcome my lovely customers and supporters to an **open house** at my home/nursery this **Sunday, October 6th, 2024, from 11am to 5pm, in Lunenburg, MA.**

(When I say "open house", I mostly mean "open garden," because y'all don't want to see the inside of my house right now!)

We will be selling our remaining plants for **40%** off regular price -- that's $3 for our pint pots and $6 for our 1-2 quart pots. (Other prices will vary). 

Additionally, anyone who attends will receive a **$5 coupon for 2025!** 

You can mark yourself as interested in the Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1159658165129331), but please [email me](mailto:lise@redtrilliumgardens.com) to RSVP and to get the address. 

Hope to see lots of you before the end of the season!
