The big news is that we'll be at two events coming up in April and May.

The first is this weekend: **[Fitchburg Earth Day](https://fitchburgcelebratesearthday2024.simple.ink/)**, April 21, 2024, from 12pm to 3pm at Riverfront Park in Fitchburg, MA. We'll be there as part of Grow Native Massachusetts' "pop-up market." 

Come plant some seeds of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and take them home with you! 

We'll also have some select native and garden herbs to sell, but it's still too early for most of our stock. But Rob's Gardens from Littleton, MA will be just next to us, if you want more fully grown plants!

The second is **[Framingham Spring Fest,](https://grownativemass.org/sites/default/files/documents/Spring%20Fest_Save%20the%20date%20SQ%20updated.pdf)** May 4, 2024, from 12pm to 4pm, on the Framingham Downtown Common in Framingham, MA. This is another pop-up market from Grow Native MA, and this time we'll be joined by [Tree Talk Natives](https://www.treetalknatives.com/) of Rochester, MA. Hopefully by this time we'll have more plants available!

Other than that... we are hoping to be part of the Lunenburg Farmers' Market on Sundays in the fall, but the applications for this year have not yet opened. We're also anticipating that our **first weekend at Montuori Flea Market in Lunenburg will be May 11 or 12**, though this is subject to change. 

Let us know if there's somewhere you'd like to see us!
