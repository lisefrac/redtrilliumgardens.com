Want a sneak peek at what we're growing for sale in 2024? See below! 

Note that there's no guarantee we will have these exact plants. Gardening, and nature, follow their own rules, and we're still learning to grow many of these. 

(And let's be real, I'll probably buy more seeds before spring!)

**Last updated:** February 19, 2024

### Native Plants

#### Purchased Seeds

These were all purchased from either [Wild Seed Project](https://wildseedproject.net/) or [Prairie Moon Nursery](https://www.prairiemoon.com/) (where we purchase only New England natives). We tend to prefer WSP, as they are based out of Maine, meaning they have a more local ecotype than the ones from Prairie Moon Nursery (which is based out of Minnesota). However, not all species are available with Wild Seed Project.

#### Self-Collected Seeds/Cuttings

These were collected myself, mostly in Lunenburg or Townsend, MA but a few from farther afield. Some of them may have double dormancy -- meaning they require two years of alternating warm and cool temperatures before they germinate -- and so may not be available this year.
