> "Monarch butterflies lay their eggs exclusively on Milkweed plants, making them the sole food source for their larvae.  Once found in abundance in nearly every farm field, ditch, and disturbed site, Common Milkweed numbers have been in dramatic decline in recent years, due in part to suburban development and the increased efficiency of herbicides used in conjunction with herbicide-tolerant, genetically modified row crops. It spreads readily by seed and underground rhizomes and its taproot can withstand drought.  Common Milkweed is one of the easiest and fastest to establish of the Milkweeds and planting more, even in small urban pockets, can provide personal satisfaction while helping to counter increasing threats to our Monarch butterfly population."
