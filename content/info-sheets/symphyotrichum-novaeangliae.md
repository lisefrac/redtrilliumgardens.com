Flowers supply abundant nectar for late-season bees and butterflies. Foliage important for many species in their larval stages. Excellent garden and landscape plant with late season interest."

> "Not the pale domesticates of the perennial border, the weak sauce of lavender or sky blue, but full-on royal purple that would make a violet shrink. The daisylike fringe of purple petals surrounds a disc as bright as the sun at high noon, a golden-orange pool, just a tantalizing shade darker than the surrounding goldenrod."
