> “Small blue, nodding bell-shaped flowers on wispy stems bloom in early to mid-summer, sometimes with repeated blooms. Attractive low clump of round basal leaves. Deer-resistant foliage.”

> --Wild Seed Project

> “Rosettes of rounded basal leaves wither early after sending up clusters of wiry stems with long narrow foliage. The slender flowering stems can rise up to 12 inches, often becoming so weak that the entire plant bends over.  The bloom time can be very sporadic and prolonged… Campanula rotundifolia does well in rocky soils and crevices, often self-seeding in retaining walls.  Some theorize that its common name alludes to an ancient association with witches, suspected of transforming into hares.”
