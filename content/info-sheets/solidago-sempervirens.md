> “Yellow flower clusters brighten sunny, dry roadsides and shorelines throughout autumn. A clump-forming mass of pale green foliage stays neat all season. Great in a sunny, dry garden or landscape edge subject to road salt. Flowers provide late season nectar for pollinating butterflies and bees, and the seeds are eaten by birds. Thrives in the rain garden. Deer-resistant.”
