> In mid-summer, small white flowers bloom atop silvery-green foliage attracting numerous pollinators – this is a top nectar plant. Foliage is minty, fragrant, and used medicinally. Thrives in poor soil and can form large clumps by spreading through underground roots, so too aggressive for small gardens. Tough enough to establish in an existing meadow of dense vegetation or in a rain garden that alternates between wet and dry. Looks great in a large pot."

> Mountain Mint attracts many insects to its flowers, including various bees, wasps, flies, small butterflies, and beetles. The leaves are very fragrant; when crushed they have a strong minty odor. The flowers will be white to shades of light purple, some with purple spots.  Pycnanthemum means ‘densely flowered,’ an attribute that enables Mountain Mint to accommodate many pollinators at once."
