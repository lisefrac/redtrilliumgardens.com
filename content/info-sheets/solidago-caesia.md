> “Wreath goldenrod is a crucial late season nectar source for bees and other insects. It also provides one of the final pops of fall color. Its axillary flowers, shorter stature, graceful arching stems, shade tolerance, and less aggressive tendencies set it apart from other goldenrods in the landscape.”
