> “Like many sedge species, its most attractive (and most photographed) phase is during its mid-summer fruiting period. The star-like flower makes Carex grayi an attractive addition to fresh or dried arrangements. Some say the flower looks more like a medieval weapon than a star, and the sedge is sometimes called Mace Sedge."
