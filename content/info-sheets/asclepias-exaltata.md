> “This little-known milkweed is the first to bloom of our local species, usually in mid-June. The dainty white or pale green flowers dangle from the stem. When planted as a clump of seedlings in part shade, it makes a handsome addition to a native garden and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Stays as a clump, does not expand from the roots. ”
