> “Red or American Columbine is one of the first plants to provide nectar in the spring for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds…. Besides being an early bloomer, Columbine will tolerate a large range of soil and sun types, so you'll have success with it in full sun as well as shade.  It can grow in pine tree areas and is deer-resistant.  The seeds of Aquilegia are shiny black and smooth - like tiny black pearls.  They can bounce on hard soil surfaces, aiding in their distribution.  Seed collection is easy.”
