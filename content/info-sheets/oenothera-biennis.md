> "Much of the life cycle of the stunning pink Primrose Moth (Schinia florida) can be in the Common Evening Primrose plant.  The small green larvae of the Primrose Moth will feed on the flowers and seed of the plant and the adult moth can often be found resting on the yellow flowers, pollinating them in the process."

> "The flowers of this night-flowering biennial open in the evening and close by noon. The plant takes 2 years to complete its life cycle, with basal leaves becoming established the first year, and flowering occurring the second. The roots are eaten by some wildlife, and the seeds are important as bird feed."
