**Notes**: There is some debate whether or not M. arvensis and canadensis are separate species, and whether or not it is native to New England. As the seed is from Minnesota, however, this is at the very least not a native ecotype. Regardless, the benefit to pollinators is the same. As with most mints, if you are concerned about them spreading aggressively, it is recommended you grow them in pots and remove flowers before seeds set.

> "This mint has tiered clusters of small white to light purple flowers which appear along the stem in the heat of summer. It primarily attracts flies and wasps for its nectar, but butterflies, and small bees will visit on occasion. All parts of the plant are very aromatic. The strong minty scent of the foliage usually keeps herbivores at bay. Mentha arvensis is rhizomatous and aggressive and therefore may not be suitable for small landscape plantings."

> "This mint is another marvelous, aggressive aromatic herb, best located in containers or wherever it can spread widely. With masses of tiny late-summer blooms, this species supports a number of insect species with its valuable nectar and pollen."
