> “Like many spring blooming natives, the bloom time on Jacob's Ladder is short but sweet.  The few short weeks in April or May that the flowers appear, the plant will be covered in blooms that range from shades of pink to blue. Jacob's Ladder will grow in full sun if it has adequate moisture, but it prefers woodlands (almost full shade) and woodland edges (partial shade.) A mature plant will only reach heights of 1' and is deer resistant.”

> “P. reptans stems are covered in numerous, small leaflets, which grow exactly opposite one another, giving each stem the ladder-like appearance which lends the plant its common name (Jacob's ladder). Blue-purple flowers bloom profusely in spring.”
