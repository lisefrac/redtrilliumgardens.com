> “An attractive annual native for rocky, shallow-soil sites and cooler climates.  Easy to start from seed, it has light to dark pink tubular flowers with bright yellow tips and greenish-blue leaves - a real stand out in the garden!  If planting seed late spring or early summer they can be biennial.  With natural seed dispersal, fall or early spring plantings are annual.  It could fill in any bare spot in a sun or semi-shade garden quite quickly, and will seed readily”
