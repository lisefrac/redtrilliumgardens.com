> "Indian Paintbrush is a sought-after prairie beauty that prefers bright sites with medium-dry to medium-wet soils. An annual or biennial, its vivid scarlet bracts nearly hide small, greenish flowers and appear to have been dipped in paint.  May and June are the typical bloom time, but because of its annual or biennial nature, you can see flowers blooming as late as October."

> "Scarlet painted-cup is an annual herb that is hemiparasitic (meaning it obtains some resources from other plants via underground connections with their roots, as well as using photosynthesis to obtain its own resources). While it grows vigorously only in the presence of a host, it has a fairly wide range of host species. It was formerly found in several New England states, but is now apparently restricted to Connecticut, where only a small handful of populations remain."
