> “Eastern prickly pear is a cactus that grows all along the coast of the Eastern US, including up through southern New England. Perfect as a specimen plant in dry, rocky, sunny spots, this cactus manages to survive in winter by decreasing the water content in its leaves, leaving high concentrations of glucose to function as antifreeze.”
